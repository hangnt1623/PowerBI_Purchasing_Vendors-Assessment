 (1) Purchasing_Vendor and Purchasing_OrderHeader
 
- Relationship: One-to-Many (1 on Purchasing_Vendor to * on Purchasing_OrderHeader)
- Fields: Purchasing_Vendor[BusinessEntityID] to Purchasing_OrderHeader[VendorID]
- Description: A single vendor (from Purchasing_Vendor) can have multiple purchase orders (Purchasing_OrderHeader).

(2) Purchasing_Vendor and Purchasing_ProductVendor

- Relationship: One-to-Many (1 on Purchasing_Vendor to * on Purchasing_ProductVendor)
- Fields: Purchasing_Vendor[BusinessEntityID] to Purchasing_ProductVendor[BusinessEntityID]
- Description: A single vendor can supply multiple products (recorded in Purchasing_ProductVendor), or a product can be supplied by multiple vendors but Purchasing_ProductVendor lists vendor-product pairs.

(3) Product_Product and Purchasing_ProductVendor
- Relationship: One-to-Many (1 on Product_Product to * on Purchasing_ProductVendor)
- Fields: Product_Product[ProductID] to Purchasing_ProductVendor[ProductID]
- Description: A single product can be associated with multiple vendors in the Purchasing_ProductVendor table. Combined with relationship 5, this creates a Many-to-Many relationship between Purchasing_Vendor and Product_Product through the Purchasing_ProductVendor bridge table.


(4) Purchasing_OrderDetail and Product_Product
- Relationship: Many-to-One (* on Purchasing_OrderDetail to 1 on Product_Product)
- Fields: Purchasing_OrderDetail[ProductID] to Product_Product[ProductID]

(6)  Purchasing_OrderHeader and ShipMethod
- Relationship: Many-to-One (* on Purchasing_OrderHeader to 1 on ShipMethod)
- Fields: Purchasing_OrderHeader[ShipMethodID] to ShipMethod[ShipMethodID]
- Description: Many purchase orders can use the same shipping method, but each shipping method is unique in the ShipMethod table.

(7) Purchasing_OrderHeader and dim_Date
- Relationship: Many-to-One (* on Purchasing_OrderHeader to 1 on dim_Date)
- Fields: Purchasing_OrderHeader[OrderDate] to dim_Date[Date]

## üìä Key Insights & Visualizations  

### üîç Dashboard Preview & Analysis

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard 1: Overview


**üìå Analysis 1**

***Oberservations***
- Profitability (North Star Metric): Overall Profit Margin is 11.61%, showing stability over time, despite fluctuations. Sales and Profit grow in parallel (Sales YOY: 51.55%).
- Customer Health: High Retention Rate (92.23%) and low Churn Rate (7.77%) indicate strong customer loyalty.
- Category Profit Disparity: Technology and Office Supplies show strong Profit Margins (both ~14%), significantly outperforming Furniture (only 7% Profit Margin).
- Segment Profit Uniformity: All customer segments (Home Office, Corporate, Consumer) exhibit similar Profit Margins (~12%). However, Corporate has the highest Return Rate compared to Home Office and Consumer.

***Recommendations***
- Enhance Furniture Profitability: Deep dive into the 7% Profit Margin of Furniture to identify cost or pricing issues. This is crucial for improving the overall Profit Margin.
- Capitalize on Top Categories: Continue investing in Technology and Office Supplies to leverage their strong (~14%) Profit Margins.
- Address Corporate Returns: Investigate the high Return Rate in the Corporate segment to protect its ~12% Profit Margin.
- Sustain Overall Growth: Maintain strategies driving strong sales growth (51.55% YOY) and high retention to support the stable 11.61% Profit Margin.

**üìå Analysis 2**

***Oberservations***
- Strong & Stable Markets:
   + APAC: Largest sales share (28.36%), healthy 12.16% Profit Margin, and good 84.91% Retention
   + EU: High sales share (23.24%), highest Profit Margin (12.69%), but also the highest Return Rate (6.21%)
   + US: Significant sales share (18.17%), strong 12.47% Profit Margin, but moderate 5.95% Return Rate
- Promising Market with Challenges:
   + Africa: Good 11.34% Profit Margin with exceptionally low 0.04% Return Rate, but suffers from very low 53.21% Retention and high 46.79% Churn
- Markets Needing Urgent Review:
  + LATAM: Moderate 10.24% Profit Margin and moderate Return Rate (5.82%)
  + EMEA: Lowest Profit Margin (5.45%) and very high 40.85% Churn Rate
  + Canada: Exceptionally high 26.62% Profit Margin, but critically unsustainable with 93.44% Churn Rate and minimal sales share (0.53%)

***Recommendations***
- Sustain & Optimize Strong Markets
  + APAC: Continue investment to leverage scale and 12.16% PM
  + EU: Prioritize reducing its 6.21% Return Rate to maximize the 12.69% PM
  + US: Focus on improving retention and reducing its 5.95% Return Rate to solidify 12.47% PM.
- Develop Africa's Retention: Invest in strategies to boost retention and reduce churn in Africa, capitalizing on its good 11.34% PM and minimal returns
- Strategic Review for Challenging Markets:
  + LATAM: Optimize operations and address its 5.82% Return Rate to enhance its 10.24% PM
  + EMEA: Requires a major strategic overhaul to address the 5.45% PM and very high churn
  + Canada: Investigate the extreme churn (93.44%) despite high 26.62% PM; unsustainable for growth

**üìå Analysis 3**

***Oberservations***
- Product Category Performance:
  + Technology (37.53% sales) & Furniture (32.51% sales) are top revenue, but Technology has Profit Margin increase gradually between 13~14%
  + Office Supplies (29.96% sales) shows consistently low and declining Profit Margin (~3-5%), significantly impacting overall PM
- Customer Segment Health by Category:
  + Office Supplies has the highest Retention Rate (~89.32%)
  + Furniture has the highest Return Rate (~6-7.5%) and the lowest Profit Margin, with sub-categories even showing negative PM
- Sub-Category Profitability:
  + High PM: Paper (24.24%), Labels (20.45%), Envelopes (17.32%), Copiers (17.13%) (Office Supplies); Accessories (17.30%) (Technology)
  + Low/Negative PM: Tables (-8.46%), Chairs (9.35%) (Furniture); Machines (7.56%) (Technology); Storage (9.62%), Supplies (9.29%) (Office Supplies)

***Recommendations***
- Maximize Technology: Invest in Technology to capitalize on its increasing 13-14% PM
- Urgent Office Supplies Review: Investigate reasons for Office Supplies' declining ~3-5% PM despite high retention; focus on high-PM sub-categories
- Restructure Furniture: Address high returns and eliminate/re-evaluate loss-making Furniture (e.g., Tables: -8.46% PM)
- Optimize Sub-Categories: Promote high-PM items (Paper, Labels) and improve/review low-PM items (Machines, Storage, Supplies)

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

> **The company demonstrates strong growth and customer loyalty, yet the overall 11.61% Profit Margin is significantly weighed down by underperforming product categories and specific markets.**

üëâüèª Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend Senior Manager to consider the following:  

üìå Market Recommendations
- Sustain Strong Markets: Keep investing in APAC, EU, and US. For EU and US, focus on reducing return rates to maximize profit
- Develop Africa's Potential: With good profit and low returns, prioritize improving retention and reducing churn to unlock growth
- Overhaul Challenging Markets:
  + EMEA: Major strategic overhaul needed due to very low Profit Margin (5.45%) and high churn
  + Canada: Investigate extreme churn (93.44%) despite high profit; it's unsustainable
  + LATAM: Optimize operations and address return rates

üìå Product Recommendations  
- Urgent Furniture Profitability Fix: The 7% Profit Margin and unprofitable Tables (-8.46% PM) are major drags. Immediately review costs, pricing, and quality. Consider discontinuing loss-making items.
- Boost Office Supplies Margin: Despite high retention, the declining ~3-5% Profit Margin needs attention. Promote high-margin sub-categories (e.g., Paper, Labels) and address inefficiencies in low-margin ones.
- Capitalize on Technology: This category shows strong and increasing 13-14% Profit Margins. Continue investment and innovation.

***-> By aggressively addressing Furniture and Office Supplies profitability and implementing targeted market strategies (leveraging strong markets, developing Africa, and fixing underperformers), the company can significantly enhance its overall profit margin while sustaining strong growth and customer loyalty.***
